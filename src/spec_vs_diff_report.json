  "summary": "Core gameplay UI appears largely implemented in frontend/src/App.tsx (levels array, team setup state, movement logic, winner state, reset, mini-game dialog state) and a cosmic theme/background is applied in frontend/src/index.css. However, the diff also adds Internet Identity/auth-related hooks and wires an InternetIdentityProvider into the app entrypoint, which conflicts with the no-auth/no-backend constraints. Additionally, the required generated image assets themselves are not present in the diff under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Add generated static image assets (starfield background and Macro → Micro badge) stored under frontend/public/assets/generated and referenced by the UI.",
      "reason": "The UI references the images, but the diff does not include the actual image files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the acceptance criteria about generated assets being stored there is not met by the shown changes.",
