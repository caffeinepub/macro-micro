  "summary": "REQ-1 is partially evidenced: App.tsx introduces MIN_TEAMS/MAX_TEAMS constants (2/20), clamping logic, and preserves existing team names when resizing. However, due to truncation there isn’t enough diff evidence that the setup label text and the numeric input’s min/max attributes were updated as required. The diff also contains several unrelated UI/architecture/theme changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",
