      "text": "Update the team setup UI to support configuring the number of teams from 2 to 20 (inclusive), including the displayed label text and all numeric input validation/clamping logic so users cannot set fewer than 2 or more than 20 teams.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On the setup screen, the label reads \"Number of Teams (2-20)\" (English).",
        "The team count input enforces min=2 and max=20 in the UI control attributes.",
        "Typing a value below 2 results in the app using 2; typing a value above 20 results in the app using 20 (i.e., onChange clamping logic uses 2..20).",
        "When the team count changes, the app renders exactly that many Team Name inputs (2–20) and preserves already-entered names for indexes that still exist.",
        "Starting a game after selecting up to 20 teams creates the same number of teams and renders their controls and positions without runtime errors."
