        "On the setup screen, the label reads \"Number of Teams (2-20)\" (English).",
        "The team count input enforces min=2 and max=20 in the UI control attributes.",
        "Typing a value below 2 results in the app using 2; typing a value above 20 results in the app using 20 (i.e., onChange clamping logic uses 2..20).",
        "When the team count changes, the app renders exactly that many Team Name inputs (2–20) and preserves already-entered names for indexes that still exist.",
        "Starting a game after selecting up to 20 teams creates the same number of teams and renders their controls and positions without runtime errors."

Implement/centralize 2..20 clamping logic (e.g., constants + helper) so both UI attributes and onChange handling consistently constrain values, and ensure the teamNames array is resized to match the clamped team count while preserving existing names for still-valid indexes. Continue using existing shadcn-ui Input/Label components (provided by the shadcn-ui component set) for numeric input and labeling; verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
